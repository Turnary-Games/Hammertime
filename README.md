# How to play
### How to win
The game is won by defeating the enemy boss. Your minions, and only your minions, can deal damage to the enemy boss.

### Wacking
If you click on an enemy minions, turrets, or projectiles, you *wack* them and deal a fixed amount of damage. This is useful to aid your minions in getting further. But you cannot wack the enemy [b0ss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gca5FF37T4) directly.

### Minions
Minions are the way to win, but also the way to lose. Both you and the enemy boss may send minions. The enemy boss sends minions in waves, but you can only purchase minions via gold. Gold is achived via demising enemies, either via wacking or letting your minions punching enemies.
